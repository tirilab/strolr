Many women find they're exhausted in the first trimester. Don't worry, this is normal! This is your body's way of telling you that you need more rest. In the second trimester, tiredness is usually replaced with a feeling of well being and energy. But in the third trimester, exhaustion often sets in again. As you get larger, sleeping may become more difficult. The baby's movements, bathroom runs, and an increase in the body's metabolism might interrupt or disturb your sleep.

A thin needle is used to draw out a small amount of amniotic fluid and cells from the sac surrounding the fetus. The sample is sent to a lab for testing. Biophysical profile (BPP) This test is used in the third trimester to monitor the overall health of the baby and to help decide if the baby should be delivered early. BPP involves an ultrasound exam along with a nonstress test . The BPP looks at the baby\\'s breathing, movement, muscle tone, heart rate, and the amount of amniotic fluid. Chorionic villus (KOR-ee-ON-ihk VIL-uhss) sampling (CVS) A test done at 10 to 13 weeks to diagnose certain birth defects, including: Chromosomal disorders, including Down syndrome Genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis CVS may be suggested for couples at higher risk for genetic disorders. It also provides DNA for paternity testing. A needle removes a small sample of cells from the placenta to be tested. First trimester screen A screening test done at 11 to 14 weeks to detect higher risk of: Chromosomal disorders, including Down syndrome and trisomy 18 Other problems, such as heart defects It also can reveal multiple births. Based on test results, your doctor may suggest other tests to diagnose a disorder. This test involves both a blood test and an ultrasound exam called nuchal translucency (NOO-kuhl trans-LOO-sent-see) screening. The blood test measures the levels of certain substances in the mother\\'s blood. The ultrasound exam measures the thickness at the back of the baby\\'s neck. This information, combined with the mother\\'s age, help doctors determine risk to the fetus. Glucose challenge screening A screening test done at 26 to 28 weeks to determine the mother\\'s risk of gestational diabetes . Based on test results, your doctor may suggest a glucose tolerance test . First, you consume a special sugary drink from your doctor. A blood sample is taken one hour later to look for high blood sugar levels. Glucose tolerance test This test is done at 26 to 28 weeks to diagnose gestational diabetes . Your doctor will tell you what to eat a few days before the test. Then, you cannot eat or drink anything but sips of water for 14 hours before the test. Your blood is drawn to test your \"fasting blood glucose level.\" Then, you will consume a sugary drink. Your blood will be tested every hour for three hours to see how well your body processes sugar. Group B streptococcus (STREP-tuh-KOK-uhss) infection This test is done at 36 to 37 weeks to look for bacteria that can cause pneumonia or serious infection in newborn. A swab is used to take cells from your vagina and rectum to be tested. Maternal serum screen (also called quad screen, triple test, triple screen, multiple marker screen, or AFP) A screening test done at 15 to 20 weeks to detect higher risk of: Chromosomal disorders, including Down syndrome and trisomy 18 Neural tube defects, such as spina bifida Based on test results, your doctor may suggest other tests to diagnose a disorder. Blood is drawn to measure the levels of certain substances in the mother\\'s blood. Nonstress test (NST) This test is performed after 28 weeks to monitor your baby\\'s health. It can show signs of fetal distress, such as your baby not getting enough oxygen. A belt is placed around the mother\\'s belly to measure the baby\\'s heart rate in response to its own movements. Ultrasound exam An ultrasound exam can be performed at any point during the pregnancy. Ultrasound exams are not routine. But it is not uncommon for women to have a standard ultrasound exam between 18 and 20 weeks to look for signs of problems with the baby\\'s organs and body systems and confirm the age of the fetus and proper growth. It also might be able to tell the sex of your baby. Ultrasound exam is also used as part of the first trimester screen and biophysical profile (BPP). Based on exam results, your doctor may suggest other tests or other types of ultrasound to help detect a problem. Ultrasound uses sound waves to create a \"picture\" of your baby on a monitor. With a standard ultrasound, a gel is spread on your abdomen. A special tool is moved over your abdomen, which allows your doctor and you to view the baby on a monitor. Urine test A urine sample can look for signs of health problems, such as: Urinary tract infection Diabetes Preeclampsia If your doctor suspects a problem, the sample might be sent to a lab for more in-depth testing. You will collect a small sample of clean, midstream urine in a sterile plastic cup. Testing strips that look for certain substances in your urine are dipped in the sample. The sample also can be looked at under a microscope.'),\n",

Sometimes, opioids also are given with epidural or spinal blocks. Opioids can make the pain bearable, and don't affect your ability to push. After getting this kind of pain relief, you can still get an epidural or spinal block later. Opioids don't get rid of all the pain, and they are short-acting. They can make you feel sleepy and drowsy. They can cause nausea and vomiting. They can make you feel very itchy. Opioids cannot be given right before delivery because they may slow the baby's breathing and heart rate at birth. Epidural and spinal blocks – An epidural involves placing a tube (catheter) into the lower back, into a small space below the spinal cord. Small doses of medicine can be given through the tube as needed throughout labor. With a spinal block, a small dose of medicine is given as a shot into the spinal fluid in the lower back. Spinal blocks usually are given only once during labor. Epidural and spinal blocks allow most women to be awake and alert with very little pain during labor and childbirth. With epidural, pain relief starts 10 to 20 minutes after the medicine has been given. The degree of numbness you feel can be adjusted throughout your labor. With spinal block, good pain relief starts right away, but it only lasts 1 to 2 hours. Although you can move, you might not be able to walk if the medicine used affects motor function. It can lower your blood pressure, which can slow your baby's heartbeat. Fluids given through IV are given to lower this risk. Fluids can make you shiver. But women in labor often shiver with or without epidural. If the covering of the spinal chord is punctured, you can get a bad headache. Treatment can help the headache. Backache for a few days after labor. Epidural can prolong the first and second stages of labor. If given late in labor or if too much medicine is used, it might be hard to push when the time comes. Studies show that epidural increases risk of assisted vaginal delivery. Pudendal block – A doctor injects numbing medicine into the vagina and the nearby pudendal nerve. This nerve carries sensation to the lower part of your vagina and vulva . This is only used late in labor, usually right before the baby's head comes out. With a pudendal block, you have some pain relief but remain awake, alert, and able to push the baby out. The baby is not affected by this medicine and it has very few disadvantages.\"),\n",

With VBAC, the most serious danger is the chance that the c-section scar on the uterus will open up during labor and delivery. This is called uterine rupture. Although very rare, uterine rupture is very dangerous for the mother and baby. Less than 1 percent of VBACs lead to uterine rupture. But doctors cannot predict if uterine rupture is likely to occur in a woman. This risk, albeit very small, is unacceptable to some women.'),\n",

DO NOT leave the baby wet - she/he will become cold. If the baby is not breathing or gasping (unless baby is dead, macerated, severely malformed): → Cut cord quickly: transfer to a firm, warm surface; start Newborn resuscitation K11 . CALL FOR HELP - one person should care for the mother. Exclude second baby. Palpate mother's abdomen. Give 10 IU oxytocin IM to the mother. Watch for vaginal bleeding. If second baby, DO NOT give oxytocin now. GET HELP . Deliver the second baby. Manage as in Multiple pregnancy D18 . If heavy bleeding, repeat oxytocin 10-IU-IM. Change gloves.

With the next contraction, and using gentle downward traction towards the mother’s sacrum, the anterior shoulder is delivered as each side of the head is held. This maneuver allows the anterior shoulder to pass under the maternal pubic symphysis. While continuing to hold each side of the head, the posterior shoulder is delivered by applying gentle upward traction. It is important to apply the least amount of traction during the delivery of fetal shoulders to minimize the risk of traction-induced perineal injury and fetal brachial plexus injuries.[37] After the shoulders are delivered, care must be maintained as the rest of the delivery is spontaneous and requires minimal maternal effort, but it is important to guide the newborn child’s body as it passes the birth canal. Once the child is delivered, the umbilical cord should be clamped after a delay. In full-term vaginal deliveries, evidence supports that delayed cord clamping, which is defined as clamping of the cord after 30 seconds, prevents anemia in infants. The umbilical cord should be clamped using two clamps that are approximately three to four centimeters apart. The partner of the mother or the accompanying family member should be afforded the opportunity to cut the umbilical cord between the two clamps. Once the cord is cut, the newborn should be cleaned, and one-minute and five-minute APGAR scores should be evaluated. If the APGAR scores are within normal limits, the infant should immediately be transferred to the mother and placed on her bare chest. Early Skin-to-skin contact between the newborn infant and mother serves a multitude of functions. It has been shown to increase mother-infant bond and attachment, improve breastfeeding outcomes, and minimize infant head loss.[38][39]'),\n",

Active management at this time of delivery can reduce the risk of severe postpartum hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusion. The active management of the third stage begins before the delivery of the placenta and includes uterotonic agent administration, application of gentle traction to umbilical cord after clamping it, and uterine massage.[40] The preferred uterotonic agent is oxytocin, which is administered immediately after the delivery of the fetus. Signs of placental separation from the uterus, such as a gush of blood, should be observed as the uterus contracts. Cord traction facilitates the separation of the placenta and enables its delivery. One method of cord traction application is known as the Brandt-Andrews maneuver, in which one hand secures the uterine fundus on the abdomen to prevent uterine inversion while the other hand exerts sustained downward gentle traction of the clamp on the umbilical cord. This maneuver leads to a reduction in the need for manual placental removal; in addition, there is a statistically significant reduction in the duration of the third stage of labor, blood loss, and incidence of postpartum hemorrhage. Once the placenta is delivered, it should be thoroughly inspected on the outside and by inverting it to check for missing pieces, because retained products of conception are a known risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage.'),\n",

If pregnant women stop using asthma medicine, even mild asthma can become severe. Lung diseases fact sheet Depression Depression that persists during pregnancy can make it hard for a woman to care for herself and her unborn baby. Having depression before pregnancy also is a risk factor for postpartum depression . Depression fact sheet Depression during and after pregnancy fact sheet Diabetes High blood glucose (sugar) levels during pregnancy can harm the fetus and worsen a woman's long-term diabetes complications. Doctors advise getting diabetes under control at least three to six months before trying to conceive. Diabetes fact sheet Eating disorders Body image changes during pregnancy can cause eating disorders to worsen. Eating disorders are linked to many pregnancy complications, including birth defects and premature birth . Women with eating disorders also have higher rates of postpartum depression . Anorexia nervosa fact sheet Bulimia nervosa fact sheet Epilepsy and other seizure disorders Seizures during pregnancy can harm the fetus, and increase the risk of miscarriage or stillbirth . But using medicine to control seizures might cause birth defects. For most pregnant women with epilepsy, using medicine poses less risk to their own health and the health of their babies than stopping medicine. About Epilepsy High blood pressure Having chronic high blood pressure puts a pregnant woman and her baby at risk for problems. Women with high blood pressure have a higher risk of preeclampsia and placental abruption (when the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus). The likelihood of preterm birth and low birth weight also is higher. Information on high blood pressure from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute HIV HIV can be passed from a woman to her baby during pregnancy or delivery. Yet this risk is less than 1 percent if a woman takes certain HIV medicines during pregnancy. Women who have HIV and want to become pregnant should talk to their doctors before trying to conceive. Good prenatal care will help protect a woman's baby from HIV and keep her healthy. HIV and AIDS Migraine Migraine symptoms tend to improve during pregnancy. Some women have no migraine attacks during pregnancy. Certain medicines commonly used to treat headaches should not be used during pregnancy. A woman who has severe headaches should speak to her doctor about ways to relieve symptoms safely. Migraine fact sheet Overweight and Obesity Recent studies suggest that the heavier a woman is before she becomes pregnant, the greater her risk of a range of pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia and preterm delivery . Overweight and obese women who lose weight before pregnancy are likely to have healthier pregnancies. Overweight, obesity, and weight loss fact sheet Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Some STIs can cause early labor, a woman's water to break too early, and infection in the uterus after birth. Some STIs also can be passed from a woman to her baby during pregnancy or delivery. Some ways STIs can harm the baby include: low birth weight , dangerous infections, brain damage, blindness, deafness, liver problems, or stillbirth . Sexually transmitted infections fact sheet Thyroid disease Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) can be dangerous to the mother and cause health problems such as heart failure and poor weight gain in the fetus. Uncontrolled hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) also threatens the mother's health and can cause birth defects. Graves' disease fact sheet Hashimoto's disease fact sheet Uterine fibroids Uterine fibroids are not uncommon, but few cause symptoms that require treatment.

Women with pregnancy related anemia are helped by taking iron and folic acid supplements. Your doctor will check your iron levels throughout pregnancy to be sure anemia does not happen again. Depression – Extreme sadness during pregnancy or after birth (postpartum) Intense sadness Helplessness and irritability Appetite changes Thoughts of harming self or baby Women who are pregnant might be helped with one or a combination of treatment options, including: Therapy Support groups Medicines A mother\\'s depression can affect her baby\\'s development, so getting treatment is important for both mother and baby. Learn more about depression during and after pregnancy . Ectopic (ek-TOP-ihk) pregnancy – When a fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus , usually in the fallopian tube Abdominal pain Shoulder pain Vaginal bleeding Feeling dizzy or faint With ectopic pregnancy, the egg cannot develop. Drugs or surgery is used to remove the ectopic tissue so your organs are not damaged. Fetal problems – Unborn baby has a health issue, such as poor growth or heart problems Baby moving less than normal (Learn how to count your baby\\'s movements on our Prenatal care and tests page.) Baby is smaller than normal for gestational age Some problems have no symptoms, but are found with prenatal tests Treatment depends on results of tests to monitor baby\\'s health. If a test suggests a problem, this does not always mean the baby is in trouble. It may only mean that the mother needs special care until the baby is delivered. This can include a wide variety of things, such as bed rest, depending on the mother\\'s condition. Sometimes, the baby has to be delivered early. Gestational diabetes – Too high blood sugar levels during pregnancy Usually, there are no symptoms. Sometimes, extreme thirst, hunger, or fatigue Screening test shows high blood sugar levels Most women with pregnancy related diabetes can control their blood sugar levels by a following a healthy meal plan from their doctor. Some women also need insulin to keep blood sugar levels under control. Doing so is important because poorly controlled diabetes increases the risk of: Preeclampsia Early delivery Cesearean birth Having a big baby, which can complicate delivery Baby born with low blood sugar, breathing problems, and jaundice High blood pressure (pregnancy related) – High blood pressure that starts after 20 weeks of pregnancy and goes away after birth High blood pressure without other signs and symptoms of preeclampsia The health of the mother and baby are closely watched to make sure high blood pressure is not preeclampsia. Hyperemesis gravidarum (HEYE-pur-EM-uh-suhss grav-uh-DAR-uhm) (HG) – Severe, persistent nausea and vomiting during pregnancy — more extreme than \"morning sickness\" Nausea that does not go away Vomiting several times every day Weight loss Reduced appetite Dehydration Feeling faint or fainting Dry, bland foods and fluids together is the first line of treatment. Sometimes, medicines are prescribed to help nausea. Many women with HG have to be hospitalized so they can be fed fluids and nutrients through a tube in their veins. Usually, women with HG begin to feel better by the 20th week of pregnancy. But some women vomit and feel nauseated throughout all three trimesters. Miscarriage – Pregnancy loss from natural causes before 20 weeks. As many as 20 percent of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Often, miscarriage occurs before a woman even knows she is pregnant Signs of a miscarriage can include: Vaginal spotting or bleeding* Cramping or abdominal pain Fluid or tissue passing from the vagina * Spotting early in pregnancy doesn\\'t mean miscarriage is certain. Still, contact your doctor right away if you have any bleeding. In most cases, miscarriage cannot be prevented. Sometimes, a woman must undergo treatment to remove pregnancy tissue in the uterus . Counseling can help with emotional healing. See our section on Pregnancy loss . Placenta previa – Placenta covers part or entire opening of cervix inside of the uterus Painless vaginal bleeding during second or third trimester For some, no symptoms If diagnosed after the 20th week of pregnancy, but with no bleeding, a woman will need to cut back on her activity level and increase bed rest. If bleeding is heavy, hospitalization may be needed until mother and baby are stable. If the bleeding stops or is light, continued bed rest is resumed until baby is ready for delivery. If bleeding doesn\\'t stop or if preterm labor starts, baby will be delivered by cesarean section . Placental abruption – Placenta separates from uterine wall before delivery, which can mean the fetus doesn\\'t get enough oxygen. Vaginal bleeding Cramping, abdominal pain, and uterine tenderness When the separation is minor, bed rest for a few days usually stops the bleeding. Moderate cases may require complete bed rest. Severe cases (when more than half of the placenta separates) can require immediate medical attention and early delivery of the baby. Preeclampsia (pree-ee-CLAMP-see-uh) – A condition starting after 20 weeks of pregnancy that causes high blood pressure and problems with the kidneys and other organs. Also called toxemia. High blood pressure Swelling of hands and face Too much protein in urine Stomach pain Blurred vision Dizziness Headaches The only cure is delivery, which may not be best for the baby. Labor will probably be induced if condition is mild and the woman is near term (37 to 40 weeks of pregnancy). If it is too early to deliver, the doctor will watch the health of the mother and her baby very closely. She may need medicines and bed rest at home or in the hospital to lower her blood pressure. Medicines also might be used to prevent the mother from having seizures . Preterm labor – Going into labor before 37 weeks of pregnancy Increased vaginal discharge Pelvic pressure and cramping Back pain radiating to the abdomen Contractions Medicines can stop labor from progressing. Bed rest is often advised. Sometimes, a woman must deliver early. Giving birth before 37 weeks is called \"preterm birth.\" Preterm birth is a major risk factor for future preterm births.'),\n",

BV has been linked to preterm birth and low birth weight babies. Grey or whitish discharge that has a foul, fishy odor Burning when passing urine or itching Some women have no symptoms How to prevent BV is unclear. BV is not passed through sexual contact, although it is linked with having a new or more than one sex partner. Women with symptoms should be tested for BV. Antibiotics are used to treat BV. Cytomegalovirus (SEYE-toh-MEG-uh-loh VEYE-ruhss) (CMV) A common virus that can cause disease in infants whose mothers are infected with CMV during pregnancy. CMV infection in infants can lead to hearing loss, vision loss, and other disabilities. Mild illness that may include fever, sore throat, fatigue, and swollen glands Some women have no symptoms Good hygiene is the best way to keep from getting CMV. No treatment is currently available. But studies are looking at antiviral drugs for use in infants. Work to create a CMV vaccine also is underway. Group B strep (GBS) Group B strep is a type of bacteria often found in the vagina and rectum of healthy women. One in four women has it. GBS usually is not harmful to you, but can be deadly to your baby if passed during childbirth. No symptoms You can keep from passing GBS to your baby by getting tested at 35 to 37 weeks. This simply involves swabbing the vagina and rectum and does not hurt. If you have GBS, an antibiotic given to you during labor will protect your baby from infection. Make sure to tell the labor and delivery staff that you are a group B strep carrier when you check into the hospital. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) A viral infection that can be passed to baby during birth. Newborns that get infected have a 90 percent chance of developing lifelong infection. This can lead to liver damage and liver cancer. A vaccine can keep newborns from getting HBV. But 1 in 5 newborns of mothers who are HBV positive don't get the vaccine at the hospital before leaving. There may be no symptoms. Or symptoms can include: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Dark urine and pale bowel movements Whites of eyes or skin looks yellow Lab tests can find out if the mother is a carrier of hepatitis B. You can protect your baby for life from HBV with the hepatitis B vaccine, which is a series of three shots: First dose of hepatitis B vaccine plus HBIG shot given to baby at birth Second dose of hepatitis B vaccine given to baby at 1-2 months old Third dose of hepatitis B vaccine given to baby at 6 months old (but not before 24 weeks old) Influenza (flu) Flu is a common viral infection that is more likely to cause severe illness in pregnant women than in women who are not pregnant. Pregnant woman with flu also have a greater chance for serious problems for their unborn baby, including premature labor and delivery. Fever (sometimes) or feeling feverish/chills Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Headaches Feeling tired Vomiting and diarrhea (sometimes) Getting a flu shot is the first and most important step in protecting against flu. The flu shot given during pregnancy is safe and has been shown to protect both the mother and her baby (up to 6 months old) from flu. (The nasal spray vaccine should not be given to women who are pregnant.) If you get sick with flu-like symptoms call your doctor right away. If needed, the doctor will prescribe an antiviral medicine that treats the flu. Listeriosis (lih-steer-ee-OH-suhss) An infection with the harmful bacteria called listeria. It is found in some refrigerated and ready-to-eat foods. Infection can cause early delivery or miscarriage . Fever, muscle aches, chills Sometimes diarrhea or nausea If progresses, severe headache and stiff neck Avoid foods that can harbor listeria. Antibiotics are used to treat listeriosis. Parvovirus B19 (fifth disease) Most pregnant women who are infected with this virus do not have serious problems. But there is a small chance the virus can infect the fetus. This raises the risk of miscarriage during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. Fifth disease can cause severe anemia in women who have red blood cell disorders like sickle cell disease or immune system problems. Low-grade fever Tiredness Rash on face, trunk, and limbs Painful and swollen joints No specific treatment, except for blood transfusions that might be needed for people who have problems with their immune systems or with red blood cell disorders. There is no vaccine to help prevent infection with this virus. Sexually transmitted infection (STI) An infection that is passed through sexual contact. Many STIs can be passed to the baby in the womb or during birth. Some effects include stillbirth , low birth weight , and life-threatening infections. STIs also can cause a woman's water to break too early or preterm labor . Symptoms depend on the STI. Often, a woman has no symptoms, which is why screening for STIs during pregnancy is so important. For more information, see our Sexually transmitted infections fact sheet . STIs can be prevented by practicing safe sex. A woman can keep from passing an STI to her baby by being screened early in pregnancy. Treatments vary depending on the STI. Many STIs are treated easily with antibiotics . Toxoplasmosis (TOK-soh-plaz-MOH-suhss) This infection is caused by a parasite, which is found in cat feces, soil, and raw or undercooked meat. If passed to an unborn baby, the infection can cause hearing loss, blindness, or intellectual disabilities. Mild flu-like symptoms, or possibly no symptoms. You can lower your risk by: Washing hands with soap after touching soil or raw meat Washing produce before eating Cooking meat completely Washing cooking utensils with hot, soapy water Not cleaning cats' litter boxes Medicines are used to treat a pregnant woman and her unborn baby. Sometimes, the baby is treated with medicine after birth. Urinary tract infection (UTI) Bacterial infection in urinary tract. If untreated, it can spread to the kidneys, which can cause preterm labor . Pain or burning when urinating Frequent urination Pelvis, back, stomach, or side pain Shaking, chills, fever, sweats UTIs are treated with antibiotics . Yeast infection An infection caused by an overgrowth of bacteria normally found in the vagina . Yeast infections are more common during pregnancy than in other times of a woman's life. They do not threaten the health of your baby. But they can be uncomfortable and difficult to treat in pregnancy. Extreme itchiness in and around the vagina Burning, redness, and swelling of the vagina and the vulva Pain when passing urine or during sex A thick, white vaginal discharge that looks like cottage cheese and does not have a bad smell Vaginal creams and suppositories are used to treat yeast infection during pregnancy.\"),\n",
